### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is an advanced, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It supports a wide range of data types and robust feature sets such as complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, updatable views, transactional integrity, and multiversion concurrency control. It's known for its reliability, data integrity, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for managing data in web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.


- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is a specific RDBMS that uses SQL as its query language. While SQL is the language used to interact with databases, PostgreSQL is the actual system that stores and manages the data.

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?

psql -d [database_name] -U [username]

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?

WHERE clause is used to filter records before any groupings are made. It applies to individual rows.
HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group. It's used after aggregation takes place.

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?
An INNER JOIN retrieves records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join.
An OUTER JOIN retrieves all records that match the condition in either one of the tables or both. It includes LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?
LEFT OUTER JOIN (or simply LEFT JOIN) returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there's no match, the result is NULL from the right side.
RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or RIGHT JOIN) returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there's no match, the result is NULL from the left side.

- What is an ORM? What do they do?
An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. ORMs allow developers to interact with a database using high-level entities such as classes and objects instead of SQL queries. They abstract the database interactions, making it easier to write database-agnostic code and manage complex queries.


- What are some differences between making HTAJAX allows for asynchronous requests, meaning the page does not need to be reloaded to get or send data. This leads to a more dynamic and faster user experience as only parts of the page need to be updated.
Traditional HTTP requests are synchronous; the entire page reloads to display new data or submit data, which can be slower and less seamless for the user.TP requests using AJAX 

  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
AJAX requests are made from the client side (usually a web browser) and can update the web page without reloading. They are generally used for asynchronous tasks.
Server-side requests using libraries like requests in Python are made from the server. They are used for synchronous tasks, like fetching data before rendering a web page.
- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a type of attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server and transmitted to the client. It is used to verify that the requester is the one who legitimately received the token, thus preventing CSRF attacks.


- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?
In web development frameworks like Flask, form.hidden_tag() is used to include all the hidden fields in a form in one go. This often includes CSRF tokens which are necessary for securing the forms against CSRF attacks. It's a convenient method to ensure all hidden fields are included in the form without manually adding each one.
